:summary: brief description of js goals

Primarily
^^^^^^^^^
this is a place to store the working files for my new js \
framework, inspired largely by the lovely Flask microframework.\
It is not entirely like Flask, in that it uses several defaults \
that are not built in to the Flask framework that I find to be \
a large help in my work. To wit:

Bootstrap!
^^^^^^^^^^
I really use Bootstrap heavily, not as a "framework", but as a \
set of defaults from which to build. As yet I have not found \
a web structure that I cannot style using a combination of it \
and other graphics resources, along with .CSS. ...

CSS
^^^
The framework uses a set of draft .css to help me maintain a \
clean and consistent style throughout a web app, without \
necessitating a full-on Bootstrap customization. I like it that \
way; the generator requires a choice of colors and fonts \
during setup, and makes a style.css file, a js file, and \
various other bits set where I like them in the file structure.

Javascript
^^^^^^^^^^
I like plain vanilla javascript set up so that it matches the \
file structure and naming conventions of the app so that I \
understand it.
